Idea 1:  
Harry Potter sorting Hat  

The user will be asked multiple questions to discover which house from Hogwarts he would be sorted into by the sorting hat.

The questions will each have four answers. Each answer possibility has a value attached to them. Each value is connected to a house and the respective traits.
All the answers values will be stored in a list. In the end the list gets checked for which value has the most occurrences and the user will get a message which House aligns most to his traits.

HOUSES AND TRAITS:  
Gryffindor = brave  
Slytherin = cunning/ambitious  
Hufflepuf = Loyal  
Ravenclaw = Wise  


Idea 2:  
Text based Role play game.

The user will play through a text based game which differs based on the decisions he takes along the way. The user will start of by selecting one of 4 characters. Each character has different skills and skill values.

CHARACTERS:  
Health all: 20  
combined skill value: 17  
Human Barbarian - strength 8 , intelligence 2 , dexterity 4, charisma 3  
Dwarf Thief - strength 2, intelligence 5, dexterity 8, charisma 2  
Elf Mage - strength 1, intelligence 10, dexterity 3, charisma 3  
Gnome Bard - strength 0, intelligence 8, dexterity 1, charisma 8  

Based on the skill value for each character decisions should be made appropriately. Each problem has different ways to solve them and needs a specific threshold of a skill value to be successful. If the skill value is too low the action will fail and the character will lose health points. If the health points reach 0 the player looses the game.

Idea 3:
PC Application monitoring Software

The goal is to create a tool that automatically tracks which program has been opened on the pc and for how long the program is being used. Additionally if a program e.g browser has multiple tabs open each tab will be measured individually.  

In the end the data will be visualized in charts and an overview will be available to see how long the user spent in total and with each program. A filter will be built to give the user the option to filter on day/week/month.  

The overall goal will bo to create a productivity software to monitor how much time is wasted with programs not associated with "work".

What does the program need to do:
1. Monitor activity (where is the user currently working)
    1.1 Which website is being used
    1.2 Which app is being used
2. Start of an automated timer once user opens an app or website
3. Automated saving of data in a Json file
4. Ability to run program in the background?

What will be seen on the webapp:
1. Overall time spent on pc
2. Spent time per app
    2.1 Time spent per website
3. Comparison of most used apps
4. Show "time lost" if time has been spent with non productive apps
