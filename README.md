Idea 1:  
Harry Potter sorting Hat  

The user will be asked multiple questions to discover which house from Hogwarts he would be sorted into by the sorting hat.

The questions will each have four answers. Each answer possibility has a value attached to them. Each value is connected to a house and the respective traits.
All the answers values will be stored in a list. In the end the list gets checked for which value has the most occurrences and the user will get a message which House aligns most to his traits.

HOUSES AND TRAITS:  
Gryffindor = brave  
Slytherin = cunning/ambitious  
Hufflepuf = Loyal  
Ravenclaw = Wise  

Additional function  
Once the sorting is completed the user will be asked questions about all the houses. If the user knows more about a specific house than an other house the house sorting will be adjusted and the house with the most correct answers and associated traits will be the new house assigned to the user.

Idea 2:
Working hours tracker.

The user will enter his working hours and the data will be stored. The data will then be check against the official working hours and over/undertime will be calculated. The user will get an overview how many hours he work per day and get a report how much over or undertime he currently has.
The programm will also include a possibility to see when the user usually generates over- or undertime.
